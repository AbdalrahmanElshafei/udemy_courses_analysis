# Udemy Data Analysis Project

This project is based on a Data Analysis course from Udemy, where I applied various data analysis techniques using Python, SQL, and Power BI to gain insights from datasets.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to analyze data and create meaningful visualizations. The dataset used contains information about [describe dataset briefly, e.g., sales, customer behavior, etc.].

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and transformation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is located in the `data/` directory. It contains [brief description of the dataset].

## Steps Involved

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data visualization and insights
